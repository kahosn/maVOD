A Node/Express modern app with Bootstrap. The app demonstrates the SPA technique (single page app) and the best practices in using Promises to accomplish asynchronous tasking on the server with JQuery/Ajax on the frontend. Mongoose is used for object modelling on MongoDB. Mocha/Chai is used for making the automated tests and Grunt is the task runner. 

This [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/AZ7XWTJX3F8) (https://youtu.be/AZ7XWTJX3F8) shows the app deployed and running at https://mavod.herokuapp.com. Please watch the video for the demonstration and instructions on how to use it.

Node app setup:

To setup a Node app locally, you need node.js to be installed on the local machine (available on Node website).

Open a command line, cd to the Node project folder, run <code>npm install</code> which installs all the required library-dependencies.

Run the server with <code>npm start</code>

Open localhost:port where port depends on what is configured in the Node app like 3000, 5000, 8080 or any other.

In this case, the server and client are running on the same local machine, good for testing purposes. Node app, however needs to be deployed to a compatible host online.
